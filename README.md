# @lindorm/monorepo

A comprehensive TypeScript library ecosystem for building secure, scalable web applications with advanced cryptography, data persistence, event sourcing, and infrastructure utilities.

## Overview

The Lindorm monorepo is a collection of 40+ TypeScript packages that provide enterprise-grade solutions for modern application development. Built with modularity, type safety, test safety, and security at its core, Lindorm offers everything from cryptographic operations to event sourcing frameworks.

## Disclaimer

This is a monorepo that I primarily use to learn new technologies and test ideas. Programming (and especially TS in NodeJS) is my special interest - my passion. I hold every package to the highest possible quality standards, because that's how I am as a person. However, there's only so many hours in a day. So while some packages are production ready (I have some forks of pylon, logger, mongo, conduit, and redis in production) - not all of them are.

### Key Features

- üîê **Comprehensive Security Suite**: JWT/JWE/JWS, multiple encryption algorithms, key management
- üìä **Multiple Database Support**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, InMemory with similar repository patterns
- üéØ **Event Sourcing & CQRS**: Complete implementation with aggregates, sagas, event encryption, event hashing, and projections for multiple different data sources
- üåê **HTTP & WebSocket Support**: Server framework with middleware composition
- üîß **Developer Experience**: Full TypeScript support, full test coverage, consistent APIs
- üì¶ **Modular Architecture**: Use only what you need, tree-shakeable packages
